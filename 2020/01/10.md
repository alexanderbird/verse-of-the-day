> Then the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, *about six

Exodus 12:37

### Notes

Was it literally 600,000 men?

Although
[eleph, the Hebrew word used for "thousand"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H505&t=KJV)
can sometimes mean company (in a military sense -- a group, not necessarily
precisely 1,000), in this case "thousand" is followed with "besides the
children". If *eleph* was not used numerically, why bother accounting for the
children separately? "600 clans" already includes the children, they're part of
the clan. It really sounds like it's numeric.

This is surprising for two reasons:

 1. that's a lot of people to evacuate. However, God is the one orchestrating
    the exodus, so I don't have a hard time believing this part
 2. There were two midwives (see [cross Reference about midwives](#2020-01-01)).
    Why are there only two midwives for more than one million people? That seems
    very low. (It would explain why it was so believable for the midwives to say
    "they gave birth before we could get to them".)
