> And they (the officers of the children of Israel) said to them (Moses and
> Aaron), "Let the LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us

> sword in their hand to kill us."
>
> So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Lord, why have You brought trouble on

>
> "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this
> people; neither have You delivered Your people at all."

Exodus 5:21-23

### Notes
- once again (like bringing his wife and family from their land and relatives),
  Moses' obedience to God causes hardship for the people around him. They can't
  yet see the end game, so it looks and feels like Moses is making things worse.
   - would it still feel this way if there was a deep belief that Moses is
     acting on instructions from God? "Moses is making it worse" vs "God is
     making it worse"...?

#### Cross-reference

after coming out of Egypt:

> Then they said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you
> taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to
> bring us up out of Egypt? Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt,
> saying, ‘Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been
> better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the
> wilderness.”

Exodus 14:11-12
