>  Then the Lord said to him, “Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with
>  you; but do not let the priests and the people break through [the barriers]
>  to come up to the Lord, or He will break forth [in judgment] against them
>  [and destroy them].”

Exodus 19:24 (AMP)

### Notes

It's a terrible thing to find yourself in the presence and under the judgment of
God if you have no covering for your sin.
