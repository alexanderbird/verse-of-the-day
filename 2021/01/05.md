Exodus 5:21-23

### Notes
- once again (like bringing his wife and family from their land and relatives),
  Moses' obedience to God causes hardship for the people around him. They can't
  yet see the end game, so it looks and feels like Moses is making things worse.
   - would it still feel this way if there was a deep belief that Moses is
     acting on instructions from God? "Moses is making it worse" vs "God is
     making it worse"...?
