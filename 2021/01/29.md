> Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
> Sabbath [a day of rest dedicated] to the Lord your God; on that day you shall
> not do any work, you or your son, or your daughter, or your male servant, or
> your female servant, or your livestock or the temporary resident (foreigner)
> who stays within your [city] gates.

Exodus 20:9-10 (AMP)

### Notes

A sabbath rest means you refrain from asking anyone around you from working on
your behalf, also. It means you get nothing done. Not you, not your family, not
folks you hire to do stuff for you, not even folks who don't care about taking a
sabbath for themselves.

Not: "prevent everyone in your sphere of influence from working"; rather: "let
nobody in your sphere of influence work for your sake or benefit". If they
follow God, then they should have that same attitude about themselves or other
folks working for their sake or benefit.
