Exodus 12:37

### Notes

Was it literally 600,000 men?

Although
[eleph, the Hebrew word used for "thousand"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H505&t=KJV)
can sometimes mean company (in a military sense -- a group, not necessarily
precisely 1,000), in this case "thousand" is followed with "besides the
children". If *eleph* was not used numerically, why bother accounting for the
children separately? "600 clans" already includes the children, they're part of
the clan. It really sounds like it's numeric.

This is surprising for two reasons:

 1. that's a lot of people to evacuate. However, God is the one orchestrating
    the exodus, so I don't have a hard time believing this part
 2. In the English translation, it sounds like there are precisely two midwives
    (see [cross Reference about midwives](#2021-01-01)), which seems like an
    incredibly small number for serving more than a million people. More
    discussion of this in the cross reference post.
