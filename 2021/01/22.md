> For the Lord corrects and disciplines everyone whom He loves, and He punishes,
> even scourges, every son whom He accepts and welcomes to His heard and
> cherishes.

> For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems grievous and painful;
> but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have
> been trained by it.
