> Therefore say to the children of Israel: 'I am the LORD; I will bring you out
> from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage,
> and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. ...'

> So Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did not heed Moses,
> because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.

Exodus 6:6,9
