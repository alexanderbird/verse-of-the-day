Exodus 21:14

### Notes

#### Heart attitude matters most

God counts premeditated murder as more severe than a crime of opportunity
(compare v14 "take him that he may die" with v13 "he may flee"). The
premeditation is what counts. 

Cross-reference Matthew 5:21-22

> “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder,
> and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ But I say to you
> that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger
> of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in
> danger of the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of
> hell fire. 

Jesus clarifies that it's the "angry without cause" that is the heart of
murderousness. I take that to mean that the premeditation that God describes
here in Exodus refers to a premeditation in anger against the victim-to-be --
especially an anger so deep that it leads (or could lead) to murder.

#### Severity of premeditated murder

The guilty party is not even safe from judgment if he were to flee to the Alter
of God.
