> And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that
> the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever."

Exodus 19:9

### Notes

This was enough evidence for the people to believe forever, but they didn't? Why
do we do this? Why do we reject the evidence before us? We pretend to be
scientifically minded, submitting to evidence when it contradicts our views. In
fact, we exercise our
[confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) and accept
only the evidence that agrees with our existing worldview. Why is it so hard to
believe thing when the evidence is right in front of us? 

We are not as logical as we like to think. We are not as scientific as we want
to think.
