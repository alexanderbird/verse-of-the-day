# Bible verse of the Day

Books chosen haphazardly, verses chosen because they interest me. It doesn't
have to be exactly one verse.

Unless otherwise noted, quotes are from the New King James Version.

### Observations

- there were only two midwives
- they're trained to deliver babies but are asked to kill them??
- they feared God
