> “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we
> drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek.
> For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first
> the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added

> its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

Matthew 6:31-34
