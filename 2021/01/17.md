> And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid ... The Lord will fight for

>
> And the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of

> the sea and divide it. 

Exodus 14:13-16a

### Notes

Why did God say "why do you cry to Me" when Moses has just addressed the people
that God will save? Is it that the "you" in "why do you cry to Me" refers to
all the children of Israel? Or is there part of the story left out where Moses
goes off on his own and calls out to God?
